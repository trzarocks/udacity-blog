## Quality
- Valid HTML
    - Use HTML semantic tags:
        - [ ] <header>
        - [x] <footer>
        - [x] <article>
        - [x] <section>
        - [x] <nav>
    - No div or section without a class or ID
- HTML formatting rules
    - All code is lowercase
    - No trailing whitespaces
    - Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
    - Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).
    - When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double).
- HTML styling rules
    - HTML documents HTML5 <!doctype html>
    - Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
    - [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).
- CSS formatting rules
    - The code does not have trailing white spaces.
    - Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
    - Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
    - The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
    - Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
    - Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. 
    - Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
    - Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
    - Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).
- CSS styling rules
    - The code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible, but as long as necessary.
    - The code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.
    - The code uses shorthand properties where possible.
    - [Optional] Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
    - [Optional] Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.
    - [Optional] Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.
    - [Optional] Code separates words in ID and class names by a hyphen.
