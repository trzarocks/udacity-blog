- [x] HTML formatting rules
    - [x] All code is lowercase
    - [x] No trailing whitespaces
    - [x] Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
    - [x] Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).
    - [x] When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double).
- [x] HTML styling rules
    - [x] HTML documents HTML5 <!doctype html>
    - [x] Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
    - [x] [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).
- [x] CSS formatting rules
    - [x] The code does not have trailing white spaces.
    - [x] Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
    - [x] Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
    - [x] The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
    - [x] Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.

    - [x] Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
    - [x] Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
    - [x] Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).

    - [x] The code uses shorthand properties where possible.
    - [x] [Optional] Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
